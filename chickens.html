    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
        (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of
        23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than
        any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
        meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
        chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4]</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the
        United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year
        old are cockerels.[10] Castrated or neutered roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are
        now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females as
        pullets,[11] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to
        20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /tʃʊk/
        to describe all ages and both sexes.[12] The young are often called chicks.</p>

    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>Chickens are omnivores.[15] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even
        animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[16] or young mice.[17]

        The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[18] The world's oldest known chicken
        was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[19]</p>
