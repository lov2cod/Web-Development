    <h2>Labrador Retriever <3 </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The Labrador Retriever, often abbreviated to the Labrador, is a breed of retriever-gun dog from the
                United Kingdom that was developed from imported Canadian fishing dogs. The Labrador is one of the most
                popular dog breeds in a number of countries in the world, particularly in the western world.

                A favourite disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid those
                with blindness or autism, act as a therapy dog, or perform screening and detection work for law
                enforcement and other official agencies.[1] The breed is best known for their obedience, loyalty, and
                playful composure. Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs. Ancestors include a breed
                used in Newfoundland as fishing dogs, that would help in bringing in the fishing nets and retrieve fish
                that had gotten away.[2]

                In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[3][4]
                had imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gundogs. Another early
                advocate of these Newfoundland dogs, or Labrador Retrievers as they later became known, was the 2nd Earl
                of Malmesbury who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[3][4]

                During the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch and the 12th Earl of Home
                collaborated to develop and establish the modern Labrador breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch
                Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally
                imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are considered to be the ancestors of
                modern Labradors.

            <h3>Origin and lineage</h3>
            Buccleuch Avon (b. 1885)

            The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. Johns Water Dogs bred by settlers in
            Newfoundland were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between the Canada and Poole in
            Dorsetshire. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what become known as the Labrador
            Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home,
            and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the
            Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the
            Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English
            Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs,
            short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.[6] Hawker distinguishes
            the Newfoundland from both the "proper Labrador" and St. John's breed of these dogs[6][7] in the fifth
            edition of his book Introductions to Young Sportsman published in 1846.[7]

            The first photograph of the breed was taken in 1856 (the Earl of Home's dog "Nell", described both as a
            Labrador and a St. John's water dog).[8] By 1870, the name Labrador Retriever became common in
            England.[2][better source needed] The first yellow Labrador on record was born in 1899 (Ben of Hyde,
            kennels of Major C.J. Radclyffe),[2][better source needed] and the breed was recognised by The Kennel
            Club in 1903. The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917.[2][better source needed]
            The Liver (now typically called Chocolate) Labrador emerged in the late 1800s, with liver-coloured pups
            documented at the Buccleuch kennels in 1892.[2][better source needed] The first dog to appear on the
            cover of Life magazine was a black Labrador Retriever called "Blind of Arden" in the 12 December 1938
            issue.[8]
